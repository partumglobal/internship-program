# Git Workflow Instructions for Creating a Feature Branch and Submitting a Pull Request

Welcome to the world of version control with Git! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of using Git to create your own feature branch for a simple login feature and submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main project.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal (command prompt or Git Bash on Windows, or the terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project using the `cd` command.
3. Clone the repository using the following command: git clone <repository_url>

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the Git repository you want to work with.

## Step 2: Create a Feature Branch

1. Change into the project directory: cd <project_directory>

Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory created during the cloning process.

2. Create a new branch for your feature using the following command, replacing `<branch_name>` with a descriptive name for your branch: git checkout -b <branch_name>


## Step 3: Make Changes

1. Open the project files in your favorite code editor.
2. Implement the simple login feature or make the necessary changes as instructed.

## Step 4: Stage and Commit Your Changes
1. Stage your changes for commit by using the following command: git add .

This will stage all the changes you've made.

2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message: git commit -m "Implement simple login feature"


## Step 5: Push Your Feature Branch
1. Push your feature branch to the remote repository: git push origin <branch_name>

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of your feature branch.

## Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Go to the repository on the Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) in your web browser.
2. Navigate to the "Pull Requests" or "Merge Requests" section.
3. Click the "New Pull Request" or "Create Merge Request" button.

4. Select the base branch (usually "main" or "master") and your feature branch. This will compare the changes you made in your branch to the main project branch.

5. Write a descriptive title and comment that explains the purpose of your pull request.

6. Click the "Create Pull Request" or "Create Merge Request" button.

## Step 7: Review and Merge
1. Wait for project collaborators or maintainers to review your pull request.
2. If there are requested changes, make the necessary updates in your branch and push the changes.
3. Once your pull request is approved, it can be merged into the main project branch by a maintainer.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a feature branch, made changes, and submitted a pull request. You're now part of the collaborative development process. Keep practicing and learning Git, as it's an essential tool in modern software development.
