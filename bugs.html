    <!-- The bug in the code is caused by a misunderstanding of the getElementsByClassName method. This method returns a collection of elements with the specified class name, not a single element. Therefore, attempting to directly change the style property of the collection will not work. -->

    let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

        elements[i].style.color = "blue";
