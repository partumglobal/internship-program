<!-- 1. Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice working with arrays and common array methods in JavaScript. -->

<!-- 1. create an array named `cars`
2. use `push()` to add 3 car names to the array
3. use `unshift()` to add 3 more car names to the beginning of the array
4. use `splice()` to remove 2 elements from the array
5. use `pop()` to remove 1 element from the array
6. use `shift()` to remove 1 element from the array
7. use `reverse()` to reverse the order of the array
8. use `sort()` to sort the array alphabetically
9. use `slice()` to remove 2 elements from the array starting at index 2
10. use `indexOf()` to determine the index of a specific car name -->

<!-- example code:
const models = ["Civic", "C300", "Camry"];
models.push("Accord");
console.log(models); // ["Civic", "C300", "Camry", "Accord"] -->


<!-- 2. Objective: The objective of this assignment is to create a task list application using JavaScript object methods to add, delete, and display tasks. -->

<!-- Create an object called taskList with the following properties and methods:

    tasks (array): An empty array to store tasks.
    addTask(task) (method): A method that takes a task (string) as an argument and adds it to the tasks array.
    deleteTask(task) (method): A method that takes a task (string) as an argument and removes it from the tasks array if it exists.
    displayTasks() (method): A method that logs all the tasks in the tasks array to the console as a list. -->
